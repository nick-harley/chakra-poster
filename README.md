#### Abstract 

Research in many fields is increasingly collaborative and data driven. Sharing and reuse of digital research knowledge requires generalised representations which afford uniform access, manipulation and reasoning across application contexts and domains. CHAKRA is a knowledge representation framework which allows for the integration and logical description of distributed, heterogeneous research data. This poster illustrates the core components of the framework.
